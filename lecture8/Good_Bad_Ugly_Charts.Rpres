Why chart?
========================================================
type: prompt

  * We make charts to communicate ideas.
  * A good chart must be:
    * Easy to read
    * Communicate your idea
    * Everything to understand the chart must be present (do not expect your audience to read all your text before they look at your chart)
    * Not mislead (intentionally or not)

Ugly Charts
========================================================
type: sub-section

  * Charts that are difficult to understand
    * Unlabeled axis
    * Indistinguisable colors
    * Nonsensical

Poor Color, Inconsistent X Scale

Pie Charts
========================================================

  * Pie charts are almost inherently bad
  * They can be aesthetically pleasing, but not accurately convey information
    * Thin slices are hard to discern
    * Difficult to compare when there are many slices
  * 3D Pie Charts are ALWAYS wrong
    * Humans will interpret volume, not area
    * The angle of view will distort the only real information

Time Series Pie Chart

Bad Charts
========================================================
type: sub-section

  * Charts that distort the truth (intentionally or not)

Are dual-scaled graphs ever good?

Dual-Scaled Axes in Graphs: Are They Ever the Best Solution? http://bit.ly/2e5oZle

> I certainly cannot conclude, once and for all, that graphs with dual-scaled axes are never useful; only that I cannot think of a situation that warrants them in light of other, better solutions. I invite you to propose viable exceptions, which I will welcome with open arms.

Dual axes time series plots may be ok sometimes after all: http://bit.ly/2ehQJyj
