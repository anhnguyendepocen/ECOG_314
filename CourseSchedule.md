# Course Schedule and Topics

* **(Sept. 2) Introduction to Basics**
  * **Part 1:** Install R and RStudio; Start RStudio, explore the features, menus and windows in RStudio, and take your first steps with R.
  * **Part 2:**	Introduce the basic R data types including vectors, arrays, lists, matrices, data frame and factors. Explore basic operations on the basic R data types. 
  * **Part 3:**	Load the mosaic package, and display the functions in the mosaic package (using Google search or `ls(“package:mosaic”)`. Use help (?) examine the summary function. 
  * **Part 4:**	Comment your work, save your workspace, and exit your R session.
  * *Homework 1 assigned*.
* **(Sept. 9) Data Input, Management and Output**
  * **Part 1:**	Read external files, keep only the variables needed, display a few lines of dataset, add comments to help later users understand what is in the dataset, and save the dataset into a native format for future use. 
  * **Part 2:**	Clean the R workspace, load and display the saved dataset. Use tally() and favstat() from the mosaic package to display the distribution and relevant information on the dataset.
  * **Part 3:**	Select variables in your dataset (by subset, column name, using logic, string search, using $ notation and by simple name).
  * **Part 4:**	Transform variables using the dplyr package, handle missing values, rename variables, keep and drop variables, remove duplicate observations, create summarized or aggregated datasets.
  * **Part 5:**	Export your dataset to some other format (SAS, MATLAB, CSV).
  * *Homework 2 assigned*.
* **(Sept. 16) R Programming and Operating System Interface**
  * **Part 1:**	Sequences and simple loops (iteration), conditional execution.
  * **Part 2:** Writing functions, specifying function arguments and output, writing for loops, and testing variable scope.
  * **Part 3:**	Implement functions for selected descriptive statistics.
  * **Part 4:**	Interactions with the operating system (`getwd()`, `setwd()`, `list.files()`).
  * *Homework 3 assigned*.
* **(Sept. 23) Generating Data** 
  * **Part 1:**	Generate numeric sequences, factors, repetitious patterns, text to create filenames, and simple loops (iteration).
  * **Part 2:**	Generate random data and simulate data that satisfy specific constraints.
  * **Part 3:**	Sample data and compute statistics.
  * **Part 4:**	Large dataset considerations.
  * **Part 5:**	Manage R dataset, files and workspace. 
  * *Homework 4 assigned*.
* **(Sept. 30) Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R**
  * **Part 1:**	Calculating summary statistics (min, max, mean, median, quantiles, skewness).  Centering, normalizing and scaling data.
  * **Part 2:**	EDA graphs (`histogram()`, `boxplot()`, `densityplot()`, `qqnorm()`).
  * **Part 3:**	Test for continuous variables (test for normality, student’s t test, equal variances test, non-parametric tests), P-values, confidence interval estimation, power of a test.
  * *Homework 5 assigned*.
  
#### (Oct. 7) Project 1: Midterm Project Presentation

* **(Oct. 14) Simple Linear Regression and ANOVA in R**
  * **Part 1:**	Model fitting (linear regression, linear regression with categorical covariates, linear regression with interactions, predicted values, residuals).
  * **Part 2:**	Conduct and interpret analysis of variance (ANOVA).
  * *Homework 6 assigned*.
* **(Oct. 21) Random Samples in R**
  * **Part 1:**	Generating data samples of a specified size in R.
  * **Part 2:**	Random sampling a dataset in R using the `sample()` function.
  * **Part 3:**	Speeding up processing by replacing for loops with matrices.
  * *Homework 7 assigned*.
* **(Oct. 28) Date and Time Variables in R**
  * **Part 1:**	Create and access Date-Time variables.
  * **Part 2:**	Date and time operations.
  * **Part 3:**	Quick introduction to time series data management in R.
  * **Part 4:**	Time series plotting.
  * *Homework 8 assigned*.
* **(Nov. 4) Producing Graphs in R**
  * **Part 1:**	Traditional graphs (line charts, bar charts, histograms, dotplots).
  * **Part 2:** R graphics packages (ggplot, lattice) and graphics devices.
  * **Part 3:**	R graphics parameters and plotting style (single and multi-plots).
  * **Part 4:**	Scatter plots with large datasets (jittering, small pints and binning).
  * **Part 5:**	Introduction to ggplot.
  * *Homework 9 assigned*.
